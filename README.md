# Sidebar
[Sidebar](https://studio.knightlab.com/projects/sidebar/) was a UX design project developed at Northwestern University's Knight Lab. We took an in depth look into understanding how readers associate context with news articles. From our needfinding, we developed a prototype for a tool that embedded context into news articles. This repository contains the code for our high fidelity prototype, which you can view [live](https://sidebar-kl.herokuapp.com).
